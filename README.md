# 200_Books
What I learned from reading 200 books in one year (5 things I learned)

Sometimes, the best personal growth book has a wizard. 
- How fiction opens your mind and can be a catalyst for growth
- Thinking outside the box - There is a great value in learning from the greats. Cutting down on learning curve.
      - But there is something more in expanding your mind and making your own connections.
